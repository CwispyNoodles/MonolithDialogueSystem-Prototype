# MonolithDialogueSystem
## About the project
### Description:
The Monolith Dialogue System is a custom editor for creating complex dialogue trees and was implemented using Unreal Engine's UEdGraph and Slate API.

### Showcase:
Coming soon

### Future Plans: 
* Randomizer Node: Select connected query nodes at random.
* Branch Node: Include connected response nodes based on conditions defined at runtime.
* Transition Nodes: Defines chunks of code that can be ran when transitioning from a Query node to a Response node and vice versa.
* Set UFUNCTIONs in a node to run code on entry and exit of that node.
